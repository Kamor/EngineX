# EngineX
currently started to "porting" my slow c# windows forms/wps enginex to c++ with SDL2
and learning c++ and conservation with SDL2

- Enginex should help me to improve my english
- EngineX should help me to learn C++, learn SDL2, go cross platforming and go deeper to the machine
- EngineX should help you to learn C++, learn SDL2, go cross platforming and go deeper to the machine
- If you have running code and access to this code, this is the fastest way to learn
- If you see it works, you remember codestructur and codesyntax faster
- If you see it don't work, you never know if you learn trueness or lie
- EngineX should help to build smaller Games or Demos
- I also try to make some more notations in code to help understanding it for beginners like me
